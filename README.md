Creating games with Godot 4 can be overwhelming for beginners, especially when you're trying to learn its interface, understand how nodes and scenes work, and learn GDScript all at once. Drawing from years of teaching experience and his popular YouTube tutorials, Robert Henning breaks down these complex concepts into clear, digestible steps. As an educator specializing in game development, he knows exactly where newcomers struggle and has crafted this guide to address those challenges head-on.
Starting with Godot 4’s setup, interface, and tools, you’ll quickly move to nodes and scenes, which are the building blocks of every Godot game. From there, you’ll explore both 2D and 3D game creation, so you’ll have a solid grasp of both worlds as you learn how to add key elements like players, enemies, collectibles, and lighting to make your game pop visually. What’s more, you’ll get hands-on with GDScript, Godot’s scripting language, to learn how to bring your game ideas to life.
By the end of this book, you’ll have everything you need to create complete games in both 2D and 3D—from level design and game state management to score tracking and much more. Whether you’re just getting started or looking to level up your skills, this book will help you take your ideas and turn them into playable games.</details>

This version of the engine introduces key features and updates that are essential for understanding and implementing the techniques we cover. Whether you’re new to Godot or have experience with earlier versions, it’s important to work with version 4.3 to ensure compatibility with the projects and concepts discussed throughout this book.

You can easily download Godot Engine 4.3 from the [official website](https://godotengine.org).
